        If your trip to New York has skimmed the city’s surface, we recommend diving its depths with a well-regarded storefront psychic who holds several offices throughout the city (see <em>Contact</em> below).
    </p>
    <p>
        Any respectable travel guide, which this publication aspires to be, should note that she spits in the face of good business at every opportunity. She is open during golden hours and most nights, though she keeps her golden hours for well-known and well-liked customers and lets nights bleed into mornings. She does not accept direct payment unless absolutely necessary, finding money to be rather cheap. Her offices are charming though unkept.
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet, she is regarded as New York City’s preeminent expert on fortune telling, mind reading, tea sipping, raucous agreement, eye contact, horoscope dabbling, personal styling, and most other spirito-human intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The active ingredient in her practice is mysterious, intractable, non-transferable, and exceptionally rare. Researchers from The London School of Economics, USC Dornsife School of Psychology, and The Center for Transcendental Meditation have studied her closely and received scant insight. Some allege she has peers: a hypnotist in Berlin’s redlight district, an acid shaman in Oaxaca, a couples’ therapist in Morningside Heights. All have been quickly dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This fruitless research and comparison have only solidified popular belief that her skill is sui generis and somewhat inarticulable. Our best attempt:
    </p>
    <p>
        Her thoughts and your own will enmesh such that the line between individual talking and listening is blurred. As you both contribute to your conversation’s cannon, it will reflect your shared personality. Your similarities will become its identity, your differences its anxieties. It will be unclear if she is telling your fortune or deciding it, and either, frankly, would be fine by you. Your body will be bruised bouncing between this rock and hard place: the excitement to speak your own mind and season the stock further, and the deep desire to hear what she has to say, hopefully in a voice raspened by shouting and laughing and a bit more wine than is advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything you see will remind you, in some way, of her. Songs, spider webs, the posture of old men playing cards, nectarines, headaches, the movement of cars in a crowded street, breezes. You will collect and compile these things, labeling them as items to discuss, orchestrating the eventual conversation in your head like a dancer visualizing their pliets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Entering her world is a responsibility as much as it is a privilege. We recommend that you take it seriously. While her offices are too small and packed with life to formally list her rules, she does have them nonetheless: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>No marijuana</li>
        <li>No cursing</li>
        <li>No silence</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Furthermore, we recommend that you leave your wristwatch at home. She will most certainly show up late to your appointment. The session will be so engaging as to make you completely lose track of time yourself. Your eventual realization that it’s time to go home will slap you upside the head and yank you up by the ear like a stern edlery nanny. The only way to blissfully ignore that pain altogether is by going bare-wristed, or at least selecting a broken watch.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no dress code, but we recommend you prepare for heat. It stands to reason that yours is not the first fortune she’s told, but it can be hard to believe that at the moment. Like a curious child she will open your skull and pick up your brain and see all thoughts scurrying underneath it like silly bugs. She will play benevolent god with them, making little ponds for them to swim in and placing pine needle hats on their heads and giving them workouts running around sticks. This all will make you feel naked like coming in from a summer skinny dip, and you will blush warmly. So, with that warmth in mind, we recommend you wear a thin breathable fabric, perhaps linen, with ample buttons to undo and holes to cut out so your heat may dissipate (for stores, see <em>Thrift Shops; Chelsea</em>, pages 18-24).
    </p>
    <p>
        You may be unclear, after an experience like this, about how to say goodbye. You’ll be coming back as soon as time and reason allow, so the parting is only brief. But the experience needs memorializing, it needs to be acknowledged and remembered. A tip won’t do, for you know how she feels about the cheapness of money. Neither will a gift, given her distaste for equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend you give her what she got into the business for in the first place: human connection and moving words. A quick peck, followed by a longer kiss, then a long smile and close-up appreciation, and if the time feels right, you may let her know: “I love you.”
